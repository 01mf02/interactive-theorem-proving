The task for this exercise was to create "a small kernel of a proof system for minimal propositional logic based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism". To be a bit nitpicky, the requirements were contradictory, because they stated the following proposition:

> Choose your favorite programming language (however choose a different one from the other participants).

You could formalise this statement in first-order logic:

	ChosenLanguage(me) = FavouriteLanguage(me) /\ !p. p ~= me ==> ChosenLanguage(p) ~= ChosenLanguage(me)

In my case, there was no model (respecting real-life constraints) that could satisfy these constraints. Proof by case distinction of "ChosenLanguage(me) = Haskell":

1. ChosenLanguage(me) = Haskell: Due to the fact that ?p. p ~= me ==> ChosenLanguage(p) = ChosenLanguage(me) (some other participant has chosen Haskell), the right-hand side of the conjunction does not hold.
2. ChosenLanguage(me) ~= Haskell: We express ChosenLanguage(me) as c and and FavouriteLanguage(me) as f. Then we have to satisfy c = f (left-hand side of conjunction), c ~= Haskell, and f = Haskell. Rewriting yields Haskell ~= Haskell, while reflexivity demands Haskell = Haskell, thus we have a contradiction.

Due to this fact, the assigment is already contradictory (in the model where all values except for ChosenLanguage(me) have been fixed). However, I decided to reconciliate myself with my old "premier amour", namely C++, to satisfy at least one part of the assignment (all participants need to choose different languages). At the end of this brief rendez-vous with C++, I painfully realised why our relationship had not worked out, therefore I created another prototype with my "amour courant", Haskell, to satisfy another part of the assignment (favourite language).


C++ solution
------------

First of all, what surprised me most was that my program never crashed during its whole development. I attribute this mainly to my consistent use of std::shared_ptr, which however increased the amount of boilerplate I wrote (typedefs, cast functions, constructor functions). Still, I have to say that C++ seems to have matured quite a bit since I last used it, and for performance-critical tasks I would even recommend it. One of the nicest "small" new features is the ability to adopt the constructor of a parent class, with the "using parent::parent;" instruction inside the child class definition. That allowed me to derive from a STL container without having to redefine all its constructors.

In my approach, I chose to create Proof and a Term classes. Every derived proof class is a proof of a term with a certain operator, such as implication or conjunction. Inside the proof class, I do not store premises and conclusions directly, but calculate them when the premises() and conclusion() functions are called. That way, one can see more precisely in those functions what the premises/conclusions of a proof actually are, however, this approach ultimately failed for some types of proofs, namely implication and disjunction. For example, implication elimination can be written like this:

    Γ |- P -> Q    Δ |- P
    ---------------------
          Γ, Δ |- Q

That means that we have to construct from two proofs a new proof. Because the proof of P -> Q is represented internally by just a term P and a proof of Q, we can also say that implication elimination adds the premises Δ to the proof of Q. However, we cannot add anything to an existing proof, as proofs are immutable! We can also not simply create a new proof of Q, because when constructing a new proof, we need to call exactly the right proof method to the term we are going to prove, and a priori, Q could be any term, therefore case distinction of Q is necessary, but might not be sufficient. The same problem holds also for disjunction elimination. Clearly, the model I chose to represent this task was too restrictive.
Still, it is possible to prove simple conjectures, as such:

    # g++ PropProve.cpp -std=c++11
    # ./a.out
    ~a, b |- ~a /\ b \/ x

I decided not to modify the program to fix the problem, even if a quick-and-dirty solution would have been easy: Just creating a child class of the Proof class which does admit proofs of arbitrary statements. This would also not have allowed to reconstruct a proof tree after finishing a proof, which was one of my secret goals. Instead, I looked into completely different approaches to the problem.


Nicod's system
--------------

In 1917, the French logician Jean Nicod showed in "A Reduction in the Number of Primitive Propositions of Logic" a proof system which could be used to prove all statements of propositional logic, but with only one operator: NAND [Alt-Logic]. Furthermore, this proof system needs only one axiom and one rule of inference:

    A|(B|C)   A
    -----------
         C

    -------------------------------------------
    (A|(B|C))|((D|(D|D))|((E|B)|((A|E)|(A|E))))


(I hope I got the brackets right. ^^)
I tried to prove some simple statements with this system, but failed to find reasonably short proofs. There is an interesting page at [Wikiproofs-Nicod], but looking at their proofs I realised that proofs for apparently very simple conjectures are overwhelmingly long. While I would have been able to formalise Nicod's logic in a theorem prover, it would have been very hard to actually prove something with it. Therefore, I did not implement Nicod's system, but kept watch for other systems.


Haskell solution: Łukasiewicz system
------------------------------------

As a compromise between the revolutionarily minimal (in terms of inference rules), but incomprehensible system of Nicod and the relatively large, but well-understood system of propositional logic, we can find the logical system of Jan Łukasiewicz. (Whose colleague, Mordechaj Wajsberg, found a version of Nicod's axiom with fewer variable names, by the way.) I finally decided to implement a theorem prover based on Łukasiewicz's system, and this time in Haskell.

    # runhaskell 04.hs
    ¬a ⊢ a → b

It features three Łukasiewicz axioms as well as modus ponens.

At the time I created my solutions, I did not yet know about the meaning of "minimal logic" as implicational subset of intuitionistic logic. (It was also not properly defined in the slides, and I cannot recall having learnt about it in previous lectures.) However, it is easy to adapt my Haskell solution to this by simply removing the third Łukasiewicz axiom.
